# gradient-descent
Project #1 for CS499: Deep Learning

How to run:

* First create an arbitrary directory

	I suggest cd'ing into gradient-descent first

	`mkdir ./.venv`

* Create a virtual environment

	`python3 -m venv ./.venv`

	Why use virtual environments? They allow everyone to execute python code
	using the same module versions.

* Activate the virtual environment

	`. ./.venv/bin/activate`

* Install module requirements

	pip3 install -r ./requirements.txt

* Execute

	python3 ./main.py <data-file>

All code has been tested on monsoon.
